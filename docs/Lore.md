Energy is everywhere around us. It makes up the planets, the stars, all breathing and all non-breathing things.

We were born in this world like any other creature. We are not the strongest, the fastest or even the smartest creature alive. Our use of energy is limited, but we have survive because we work together and we bond with nature.

### Beasts and Beast Tamers ###

The world of CCGMon is not too disimilar to ours. The main difference is the use of energy in the universe is amplified and every living creature is able to excert, transform and control it much more flexibly. For instance the equivalent of an electric eel is able to produce deadly amounts of electricity. The shell of a turtle is harder than steel. Body heat of some animals can exceed that of a furnace.

The human on the other hand is pretty much our version of an animal. In relation to everything else in this world humans are weak. They live comunally and build, use science and work together. They have much more advanced science but they are also much more connected to nature. The main reason people have survived in this world is because they were able to coexist humbly and peacefully in nature and make friends.

Beast taming is a highly admired and also dangerous practice. It is generally though by sages who take on one or two apprentices and teach them how to connect and look after nature.

Beast tamers are people who are able to build a special bond with beasts and communicate with them.
